# Time-lapse Calculator
This is a simple app that I have been selling in the App Store since 20014 and have decided to open source. It was originally built as web app. So the core layout is constructed in HTML and CSS with logic in JavaScript. Other than converting it into an iOS app, I have made very few modifications over the years. It still seems to function on the latest iPhones and iPads though and is apparently still useful to photographers, because I continue to get positive feedback from App Store purchasers.

If you would like to contribute and run with it, by all means, go forth!

# Description

A quick and easy time-lapse calculator with three modes. The default mode allows you to determine the shutter interval (time between shots) that is required to achieve a desired video clip length for a given recording duration.

The Time-lapse Calculator can also be set to calculate the necessary event duration (recording time) or target duration (video clip length) based on the other variables.

Most time-lapse utilities only allow you to enter the recording duration and shutter interval. Then they calculate the duration of the video clip that would result. That is rarely useful.

If you know how long you would like the final clip to be, your video frame rate, and how long you plan to continue capturing exposures to cover the event, then it is the shutter interval variable that you need to calculate. If you know what shutter interval you would like use and how long your video clip needs to be, it is the recording time that you need to calculate.

In addition to the intervalometer functions, the Time-lapse Calculator estimates the memory card storage capacity that will be required for RAW or high-quality JPG image files, based on the megapixel count of your camera.
